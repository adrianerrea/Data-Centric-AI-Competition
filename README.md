# Data-Centric AI Competition from DeepLearning.AI

A collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Landing AI, the Data-Centric AI Competition aims to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models.

In most machine learning competitions, you are asked to build a high-performance model given a fixed dataset. However, machine learning has matured to the point that high-performance model architectures are widely available, while approaches to engineering datasets have lagged. The Data-Centric AI Competition inverts the traditional format and instead asks you to improve a dataset given a fixed model. We will provide you with a dataset to improve by applying data-centric techniques such as fixing incorrect labels, adding examples that represent edge cases, apply data augmentation, etc.
